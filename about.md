Hello reader,

My name is Martin Clausen and iam a B. Eng. IT currently employed at [d60 A/S](http://www.d60.dk) as a software developer. 

Iam passionate about developing great products through clean an maintainable code, 
conquering ineffectiveness by processes and delivering a professional experiences to our customers.
In my relative short experience as a developer i've stumbled upon many different branches of the IT world (startups, product developement and consultancy) and each given my a unique experience in how to (and not to) deliver sustainable software solutions on time.

I believe in individual growth in a strong self organizing teams, where teamwork and collaboration has the highest priority. Awesome teams == Greater products.

When iam not dealing with software, customers or other technical interresting stuff, I spend alot of my spare time doing crossfit, but i won't nag you with that.
