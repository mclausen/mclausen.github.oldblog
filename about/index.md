Hey there fellow developer! I assume

<br />
My name is Martin I'am a passionate developer an avid Crossfitter and a happy consumer of life! Iam always on the run, having 100 of things to do on a normal day, and like all people I tend to forget half i my accomplishments in the rush. Thats is why i started this blog. To have a place where I can share my findings and keep track of all the neat technical stuff i'll learn on my path to become a kick-ass developer. Iam pretty new to this so called blogging so feedback we'll be greatly appreciated :)

<br />
I've currently been practicing software development for around seven years and in that timespan I've come to cross alot of different ways planning, developing and delivering software. In the same timespan i managed to work as a freelancer, project based employment aswell as an consultant and that have given me some great experiences both personally and professionally and hopefully there a some solid advice in between the lines!

<br />
Great things comes from hard work, and much of my out-of-office hours is spend in the gym, doing all sorts of crazy things from gymnastics to olympic weightlifting to enduring cardiovascular workouts. I am very much into having a healthy and balanced lifestyle, which gives me alot of energy and is a big part of my personal trait.

<br />
Lets me know what you think, and have a great day!
<br />
Martin Clausen
